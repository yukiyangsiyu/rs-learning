# About {.unnumbered}

Hi! I'm Siyu Yang. My undergraduate degree was in management and I got this degree in University Electronic Science and Technology of China. During my undergraduate period i learnt a range of things - not only the knowledge about management, but also plenty of city-related knowledge such as urban planning and design as well as a little bit coding technique. I really fancy in cities and i thought future cities are inseparable from the development of science and technology. That's why i chose to study in CASA.
