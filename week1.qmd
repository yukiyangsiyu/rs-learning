# Week 1-Introduction to Remote Sensing

## summary

### What is remote sensing?

Remote sensing is like a high-tech camera that takes pictures of the Earth. These "cameras" are installed on various platforms, such as high-altitude aircraft or drones and satellites. They capture details of the Earth's surface **from long distances** and help us understand and monitor changes in the environment.

### Active and passive sensors

As mentioned above, these "cameras" are sensors. The difference between active and passive sensors mainly lies in **the source of energy**: passive sensors rely on energy reflected from the sun or artificial light sources, while active sensors can actively emit electormagentic waves (such as radar waves or X-rays) and receive the signals reflected back. This significantly improves the performance and accuracy of active sensors at night or in adverse weather conditions.

### Electromagnetic radiation

-   Remote sensing sensors primarily focus on receiving electromagnetic radiation, which includes **all waves reflected from the surface of an object**.

-   Electromagnetic wave has two components: electric fields (E) and magnetic fields (F). The electric and magnetic fields are **perpendicular** to each other, and they are also perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave.

-   The main elements of electromagnetic waves include: **wavelength** (The distance between two adjacent wave crests) **frequency** (the number of vibrations per unit time, which determines the color or energy level of the wave) **amplitude** (the height of the wave, which affects the intensity or brightness of the wave) **speed** ( The propagation speed of electromagnetic waves in vacuum is usually the speed of light, which is approximately 3.00×10\^8 meters/second).

-   The electromagnetic **spectrum** is the range of electromagnetic radiation formed by wavelength or frequency, including short-wave gamma rays, X-rays, and ultraviolet light, through the spectrum visible to the human eye (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), to long-wave infrared rays, microwaves, and radio waves .

-   Electromagnetic waves **interact** with the Earth's **surface** by being absorbed, transmitted, or reflected. The specific interaction depends on the surface material and the wave's properties. In the **atmosphere**, electromagnetic energy encounters particles that can scatter the waves. The scattering varies by the size of the particles relative to the wavelength: Rayleigh scattering occurs with smaller particles, Mie scattering with similar-sized particles, and non-selective scattering with larger particles. This scattering affects the colors we see in the sky, especially at sunrise and sunset when the path through the atmosphere is longer, leading to more scattering of shorter wavelengths and allowing longer wavelengths like red and orange to dominate the sky.

### Four resolutions

**Spectral** resolution: refers to the sensor's ability to distinguish different wavelengths (or frequencies) of electromagnetic radiation. Different features on Earth's surface have unique spectral signatures which can be detected by the sensor. Hyperspectral remote sensing can distinguish hundreds of narrow wavelength bands for detailed analysis of material composition.

**Spatial** resolution: refers to the size of the ground area represented by one pixel in the image, which determines the level of detail of the remote sensing image. High spatial resolution means more detailed ground information.

**Temporal** resolution: refers to how often the sensor re-covers the same area and is critical for monitoring changes (such as vegetation growth, urban expansion).

**Radiation** resolution: refers to the sensor's ability to detect and distinguish between different radiation intensity levels. High radiometric resolution helps identify weak radiometric changes.

### The choice of data

When selecting remote sensing data, it's crucial to consider both environmental and sensor constraints which dictate the suitability of data types for specific needs. For instance, active remote sensing techniques like radar are preferable during cloudy conditions as they can penetrate cloud cover. High spectral resolution data might be required for detailed vegetation analysis. Thus, the choice of remote sensing data hinges on the balance of these factors alongside the mission's objectives, environmental conditions, and sensor capabilities.

## Application

Remote sensing data's ability to capture detailed information over broad, often inaccessible areas, and at regular intervals, makes it a powerful tool for environmental monitoring and disaster management.

### Sentinel-3

The utilization of Copernicus Sentinel-3 data for monitoring high temperatures in Ahmedabad demonstrates the critical role satellite observations play in urban heat management and climate monitoring. Sentinel-3, with its advanced instruments like the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR), provides accurate measurements of land surface temperature (LST), which is essential for understanding and addressing the impacts of heatwaves.

In Ahmedabad, it reached 47°C, peaking at 65°C in areas around Ahmedabad, marked in deep red.

### In india

Navalgund, Ranganath R., et al(2007) highlights the vital role of India's remote sensing applications across various fields. It showcases advancements in agriculture through crop monitoring and yield estimation, water security through groundwater prospect mapping and reservoir monitoring, and environmental protection by tracking forest cover and biodiversity. Furthermore, it addresses disaster management through real-time flood and drought assessments, demonstrating the significant impact of the Indian Space Programme on sustainable development and disaster resilience.

## Reflection

This was my first lesson in remote sensing technology. From these, I learned how remote sensing technology allows us to observe and analyze the Earth from different angles and distances. The acquisition and analysis of remote sensing data opens up new perspectives in studying phenomena on the Earth's surface and atmosphere, allowing us to monitor important areas such as agricultural production, water resources management, and environmental changes. In particular, I realized the importance of accurate information and scientific explanations on how to correctly understand the scientific principles of natural phenomena, such as why the sky is blue. Through the correct explanation of Rayleigh scattering, I learned that the shorter wavelength light (blue light) in the atmosphere scatters more strongly than the longer wavelength light (such as red light), thus causing the blue sky we see. Additionally, this learning experience reinforced my understanding of the natural world by highlighting the importance of continuous learning and verifying the accuracy of the information we receive.
