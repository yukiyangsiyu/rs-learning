# Week 8-Temperature

## Summary

The focus for this week is the phenomenon known as Urban Heat Island (UHI), where urban areas experience higher temperatures than their rural surroundings. This effect is primarily attributed to factors such as limited greenery, heat-absorbing construction materials, and dense urban layouts that restrict airflow and enhance heat retention. Notably, UHIs can lead to severe social, economic, and environmental consequences, evidenced by the 2010 heat disaster in Ahmedabad that killed more than 1,000 people.

Globally, there are policies addressing UHIs, notably within the Sustainable Development Goals, advocating for more verdant urban areas to temper the UHI effect. Additionally, the United Nations Environment Program's "Beat the Heat handbook" furnishes planners with a systematic approach and a suite of interventions adaptable to various urban contexts.

Remote sensing is a critical tool that offers comprehensive temperature data, which is essential for a deeper understanding of UHI dynamics. Through satellites like Landsat and MODIS, it provides detailed temperature observations. The high temporal resolution of MODIS, in particular, enables frequent monitoring, which enhances our ability to track and analyze temperature variations over time.

In the context of UHI, remote sensing data is invaluable for policy and decision-making. It enables the detection and ongoing surveillance of UHI effects, thereby facilitating targeted and effective urban planning interventions. Moreover, this data can illuminate the complex interactions within urban environments that contribute to UHI, guiding the development of strategies to counteract them.

In summary, remote sensing stands as an indispensable ally in the quest to understand and mitigate the UHI effect. It provides the detailed, nuanced temperature data necessary for cities to enact policies that will effectively cool urban environments and reverse the trend of rising urban temperatures.
