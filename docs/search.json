    "text": "About\n\n\n\n\n\nHi! I’m Siyu Yang. I earned my undergraduate degree in management from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. During my undergraduate studies, I learned a wide range of subjects—not only management knowledge but also plenty of city-related topics such as urban planning, design, and even some coding techniques. I have a keen interest in cities and believe that the future of urban development is inseparable from the advancement of science and technology. This led me to choose CASA for further specialization, aiming to deepen my understanding of how technology can be applied to urban challenges.\nWhile I have not yet had the opportunity to gain formal professional experience, my academic journey has been rich with involvement in various research projects and volunteer initiatives. One notable project was my engagement in urban planning research for Chengdu Wenjiang District, where I conducted thorough field research and analyzed its developmental challenges. This effort, particularly praised by my professors, underscores my proactive involvement in urban planning. Additionally, my work with a volunteer team, where I participated in teaching and organizing fundraising events in disadvantaged areas, not only taught me the true essence of dedication but also deepened my understanding of the critical role of urban development in enhancing social welfare and education.\nRealizing that data is indispensable to our lives and the development of cities, I began to understand the urgent need for data processing skills. This website is my remotely sensing learning diary. Through this module, I expect to learn how to apply technology, especially remotely sensing technology, to address global challenges such as climate change, urban planning and environmental protection, thereby improving the ability of urban sustainable development."

    "text": "1.1 1.1 summary\n\n1.1.1 1.1.1 What is remote sensing?\nRemote sensing is like a high-tech camera that takes pictures of the Earth. These “cameras” are installed on various platforms, such as high-altitude aircraft or drones and satellites. They capture details of the Earth’s surface from long distances and help us understand and monitor changes in the environment.\n\n\n1.1.2 1.1.2 Active and passive sensors\nAs mentioned above, these “cameras” are sensors. The difference between active and passive sensors mainly lies in the source of energy: passive sensors rely on energy reflected from the sun, while active sensors can actively emit electormagentic waves (such as radar waves or X-rays) and receive the signals reflected back. This significantly improves the performance and accuracy of active sensors at night or in adverse weather conditions.\n\n\n1.1.3 1.1.3 Electromagnetic radiation\nRemote sensing sensors primarily focus on receiving electromagnetic radiation, which includes all waves reflected from the surface of an object. In electromagnetic waves, the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other, and they are also perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave."
