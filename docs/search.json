    "text": "About\n\n\n\n\n\nHi! I’m Siyu Yang. I earned my undergraduate degree in management from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. During my undergraduate studies, I learned a wide range of subjects—not only management knowledge but also plenty of city-related topics such as urban planning, design, and even some coding techniques. I have a keen interest in cities and believe that the future of urban development is inseparable from the advancement of science and technology. This led me to choose CASA for further specialization, aiming to deepen my understanding of how technology can be applied to urban challenges.\nWhile I have not yet had the opportunity to gain formal professional experience, my academic journey has been rich with involvement in various research projects and volunteer initiatives. One notable project was my engagement in urban planning research for Chengdu Wenjiang District, where I conducted thorough field research and analyzed its developmental challenges. This effort, particularly praised by my professors, underscores my proactive involvement in urban planning. Additionally, my work with a volunteer team, where I participated in teaching and organizing fundraising events in disadvantaged areas, not only taught me the true essence of dedication but also deepened my understanding of the critical role of urban development in enhancing social welfare and education.\nRealizing that data is indispensable to our lives and the development of cities, I began to understand the urgent need for data processing skills. This website is my remotely sensing learning diary. Through this module, I expect to learn how to apply technology, especially remotely sensing technology, to address global challenges such as climate change, urban planning and environmental protection, thereby improving the ability of urban sustainable development."

    "text": "1.1 summary\n\n1.1.1 What is remote sensing?\nRemote sensing is like a high-tech camera that takes pictures of the Earth. These “cameras” are installed on various platforms, such as high-altitude aircraft or drones and satellites. They capture details of the Earth’s surface from long distances and help us understand and monitor changes in the environment.\n\n\n1.1.2 Active and passive sensors\nAs mentioned above, these “cameras” are sensors. The difference between active and passive sensors mainly lies in the source of energy: passive sensors rely on energy reflected from the sun or artificial light sources, while active sensors can actively emit electormagentic waves (such as radar waves or X-rays) and receive the signals reflected back. This significantly improves the performance and accuracy of active sensors at night or in adverse weather conditions.\n\n\n1.1.3 Electromagnetic radiation\n\nRemote sensing sensors primarily focus on receiving electromagnetic radiation, which includes all waves reflected from the surface of an object.\nElectromagnetic wave has two components: electric fields (E) and magnetic fields (F). The electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other, and they are also perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave.\nThe main elements of electromagnetic waves include: wavelength (The distance between two adjacent wave crests) frequency (the number of vibrations per unit time, which determines the color or energy level of the wave) amplitude (the height of the wave, which affects the intensity or brightness of the wave) speed ( The propagation speed of electromagnetic waves in vacuum is usually the speed of light, which is approximately 3.00×10^8 meters/second).\nThe electromagnetic spectrum is the range of electromagnetic radiation formed by wavelength or frequency, including short-wave gamma rays, X-rays, and ultraviolet light, through the spectrum visible to the human eye (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), to long-wave infrared rays, microwaves, and radio waves .\nElectromagnetic waves interact with the Earth’s surface by being absorbed, transmitted, or reflected. The specific interaction depends on the surface material and the wave’s properties. In the atmosphere, electromagnetic energy encounters particles that can scatter the waves. The scattering varies by the size of the particles relative to the wavelength: Rayleigh scattering occurs with smaller particles, Mie scattering with similar-sized particles, and non-selective scattering with larger particles. This scattering affects the colors we see in the sky, especially at sunrise and sunset when the path through the atmosphere is longer, leading to more scattering of shorter wavelengths and allowing longer wavelengths like red and orange to dominate the sky.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Four resolutions\nSpectral resolution: refers to the sensor’s ability to distinguish different wavelengths (or frequencies) of electromagnetic radiation. Different features on Earth’s surface have unique spectral signatures which can be detected by the sensor. Hyperspectral remote sensing can distinguish hundreds of narrow wavelength bands for detailed analysis of material composition.\nSpatial resolution: refers to the size of the ground area represented by one pixel in the image, which determines the level of detail of the remote sensing image. High spatial resolution means more detailed ground information.\nTemporal resolution: refers to how often the sensor re-covers the same area and is critical for monitoring changes (such as vegetation growth, urban expansion).\nRadiation resolution: refers to the sensor’s ability to detect and distinguish between different radiation intensity levels. High radiometric resolution helps identify weak radiometric changes.\n\n\n1.1.5 The choice of data\nWhen selecting remote sensing data, it’s crucial to consider both environmental and sensor constraints which dictate the suitability of data types for specific needs. For instance, active remote sensing techniques like radar are preferable during cloudy conditions as they can penetrate cloud cover. High spectral resolution data might be required for detailed vegetation analysis. Thus, the choice of remote sensing data hinges on the balance of these factors alongside the mission’s objectives, environmental conditions, and sensor capabilities."
